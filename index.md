# GooseMod user-made documentation

## What is GooseMod

[GooseMod](https://goosemod.com/) is a lightweight modification for
[Discord](https://discord.com/).

## Purpose of this documentation

GooseMod is very easy to pick up as a user, but some aspects like module
development aren't as easy to get into unless you enjoy filtering and reading
other people's code. Whilst there is an
[official documentation](https://github.com/GooseMod/Docs) in the works, this
is a collection of things we learnt while making modules for fun. It is not
meant to replace the official documentation, but rather complete it or document
what has yet not been documented there.
